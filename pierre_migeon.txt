I am a third year PhD student in the Interdepartmental Genetics Program at Kansas State University. I have a background in molecular biology as well as training and experience in Bioinformatics. My thesis work is in Maize genomics. I am analyzing with Bionano maps in order to better understand structural variation between corn varieties. I use Perl and bash scripting routinely for my research and have prior experience teaching programing to fellow graduate students.
