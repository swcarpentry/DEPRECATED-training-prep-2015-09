My name is Elliott Sales de Andrade and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of
Toronto studying Seismology. My research focuses on imaging the deep interior of
the Earth for which I use various Fortran packages and Python for day-to-day
analysis. I am also a session leader in the University of Toronto Scientific
Coders group and have given talks about git and Python.
