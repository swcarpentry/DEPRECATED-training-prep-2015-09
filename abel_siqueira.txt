I'm a professor at Federal University of Paran√°, in Brazil.
I work with Applied Mathematics, specifically, Nonlinear Optimization.
My line of work involves a great deal of programming, mostly using MatLab,
but I rather use open source alternatives.
I'm currently engaged on Julia language, but I also now a little of Python,
Bash and C. I also use git and LaTeX on a daily basis.
