I am a research scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington at Genomics Core Facility in the biology department. I am here to 1) provide bioinformatics support with the analysis of the next generation sequence data, and 2) provide our students with resources to learn computational skills. I have experience with Linux shell, bash, R, Perl and  python programming. My goal is to set up regular software and data carpentry workshops and instructor training on campus with hope that one day we will have an active and enthusiastic team that can lead workshops througout Dallas-Fort Worth area.
