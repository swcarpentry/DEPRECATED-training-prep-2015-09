I am working on a PhD in Psychology at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on how testosterone affects the brain and behaviour, especially social and reproductive behaviour. I have secondary research interests in evolution and sexual selection. I conduct my data and statistical analyses in R and have attended a Software Carpentry workshop in the past. I am also a session leader in the University of Toronto Scientific Coders group.
