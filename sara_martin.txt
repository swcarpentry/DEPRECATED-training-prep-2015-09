I am an evolutionary biologist working in a government laboratory with plants. I investigate topics inclusing the evolutionary consequences herbicide resistance, the 
population genetics of weeds, and the potential for hybridization between crop species and their wild relatives as well as the potential evolutionary consequences of 
these liasons.
