I'm the Data Librarian for the UCSD Library. I have over 7 years of helping researchers with data research and statistical tools, such as R, Stata, & python. I also work with our Research Data Curation Program to educate researchers on data management and research tools (including R, python, etc.). I have taught R and SQL with SW/D carpentry materials at both UCSD and UC Berkeley.
