I'm a master's student in structural engineering and teaching
assistant. My work consists in programming structural rod theories
with exact kinematics and elastoplastic constitutive model for
analysis with the finite element method. Most of my programming is
with python bindings to C/C++ libraries and bash scripts to automate a
few tasks and occasionally analyze logs.
