I am currently a Master's student at the University of Toronto in the Department of Biochemistry, and my work involves using high throughput methodolgies to understand RNA regulation during DNA replication stress. I frequently use R to analyze and visualize my data and have taught an R course to fellow graduate students through the Graduate Professional Skills program at U of Toronto.
