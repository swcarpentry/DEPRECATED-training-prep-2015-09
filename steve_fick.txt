My name is Steve Fick and I'm a PhD student in ecology at the University of California, Davis. My research involves using computational methods in data science to address landscape-level issues in the management of ecological systems, particularly in regards to restoration and conservation. I am broadly interested in bridging the gap between developers and practitioners, and have enjoyed teaching basic programming using R in several graduate course lab sections.
