Hey there, my name is Jeff Stafford and I'm a Master's student at the University of British Columbia. My work focuses on behavioral neuroscience in Drosophila, and I do a lot of bioinformatics and video/image analysis programming.

I teach workshops on programming pretty regularly (with SWC affiliated groups), here are a few examples:
+ [Plotting with ggplot2](https://gist.github.com/kazi11/22fac11fecd5dd5121b2)
+ [R package development with devtools, roxygen2, and testthat](https://github.com/kazi11/TestPackage)
+ [MATLAB (lots of topics)](https://github.com/kazi11/matlab_tutorial)
+ [Retrieving data from online databases using biomaRt](https://github.com/kazi11/biomaRt_tutorial)
