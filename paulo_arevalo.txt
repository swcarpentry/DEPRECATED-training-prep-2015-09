I am a Geography PhD student in the Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University.
I use time series of all available Landsat satellite imagery to map and understand land cover change in the tropics.
This requires the collection of training data to classify time series segments, analysis of resulting annual maps of land cover,
and identification of temporal trends based on defined transitions of interest (e.g. conversion from forest to pastures).
