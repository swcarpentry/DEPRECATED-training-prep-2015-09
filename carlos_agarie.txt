I am an electrical engineer currently on a Master of Sciences in Machine
Learning at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), in Brazil. I have 2.5 years of
experience with Python (using it both for back-end web development and
scientific computing). I was also a mentor for Google Summer of Code in 2014
and 2015, as a member of an organization called SciRuby.
