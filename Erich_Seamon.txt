Hi - My name is Erich Seamon - Im a Ph.D. student in data mining and machine learning for climatic processes - @ the University of Idaho, Department of Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences.  My dissertation is focused on developing effective machine learning models for predictive analysis of biophysical hazards, such as landslides, water risks, and fire, using python and R.  I am especially interested in the software and data carpentry workshops - to extend data integration techniques for collaborative scientific research efforts.
