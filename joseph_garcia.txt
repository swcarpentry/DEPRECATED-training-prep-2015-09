I'm a senior studying computer science at the U of A and I'm a student software developer at the iPlant Collaborative where I work mainly on Atmosphere. 
Atmosphere is a cloud based computing service for scientists. You can view it on github at https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/atmosphere.
