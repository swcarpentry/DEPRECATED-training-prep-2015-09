I am a PhD student in the Information School at University of Washington, working in the DataLab. I was a Data Science for Social Good summer fellow at the eScience institute at University of Washington in the Summer of 2015. My undergraduate degree was in neuroscience. I use Python for data analysis, although I also have some experience with R. I have been a helper in Software Carpentry workshops, as well as a mentor in Community Data Science Workshops offered at UW.
