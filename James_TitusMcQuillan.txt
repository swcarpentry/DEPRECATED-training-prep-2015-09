I am a PhD Student at UT Arlington majoring in Quantitative Biology. My work is genomics based investigating hybrid zones within the Australian gecko complex (Heteronotia binoei). My work utilizes python, shell, and bioinformatic pipelines in order to garner results for big data that is synonomous with genomic type work. I have gathered many skills using programming based methods in order to analyze my data and would love to share my expertise with other students either in the field or going into the field through Software Carpentry.
