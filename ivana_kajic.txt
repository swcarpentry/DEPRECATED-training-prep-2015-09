I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience at Plymouth University, UK and
a visiting scholar at University of Waterloo in Canada. I am using computer
simulations of neural networks to investigate human cognition and intelligence.
I am interested in programming education and teaching programming to students
without technical backgrounds.
