I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Core Faculty Member of the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences at the University of Washington. My research primarily involves financial markets and conflict, but includes other quantitative work in international relations. I teach the many of the statistical methods courses for the graduate students in the political science Ph.D. program here.
