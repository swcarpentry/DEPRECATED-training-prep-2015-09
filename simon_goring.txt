I am an Assistant Scientist at the University of Wisconsin
I maintain an active GitHub account http://github.com/SimonGoring
I study past land use change, forest cover and climate interactions over the last 21 thousand years.
I have built an R package for ROpenSci (neotoma) and work extensively in R
I took a Software Carpentry course at UW-Madison (Python & Git)
I am teaching using Python, but would like to improve my software instruction skills
I'd like to meet other people dedicated to improving their pedagological skills.
