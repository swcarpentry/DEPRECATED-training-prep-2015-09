I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Maine-Orono. I study how and why plants make fruits in the ways that they do. In addition to my fieldwork, I also dabble in statistics and simulation modeling, both using R, and it's these skills that I would like to be able to teach to prospective ecologists in the future as a professor.
