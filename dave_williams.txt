I'm a postdoc in Biology at the University of Washington, affiliated with the data science center there. I study muscle contraction and animal locomotion. Besides the typical data management that goes along with experiments, I have some massively parallel python models of muscle protein interaction that I've written. I've taught some self-designed one-day python seminars before, but like the organization and curriculum Software Carpentry has developed.
