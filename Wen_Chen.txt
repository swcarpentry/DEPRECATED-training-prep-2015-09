My research focuses on biodiversity using omics approach in supporting sustainable agriculture.
I have over 8 years experience in developing and using bioinformatics tools to process and analyze larger biological data sets.
My lab provides trainings and consultation in R, perl, bash and the use of in-house software to colleagues and students in North America.
We hope to improve our teaching skills and knowledge.
