My name is Ryan Peek and I'm a PhD candidate in ecology at the University of California, Davis. 
I am a researcher at the Center for Watershed Sciences and my research focuses on applied freshwater river ecology, in particular the effects of landscape change 
and river regulation on population genetics of amphibians. I am particularly interested in applied research and communication, and have helped teach R and basic git use
to a number of fellow graduate students and other researchers.
