I'm a software developer in Brisbane, Australia. I've worked at a radio station for the last 2 years. Some of my jobs have included: encoding and decoding audio and data streams for satellite transmission; creating a monitoring, backup, and control system to keep the station on-the-air and take corrective action in the event of a fault; and building a system to collate data gathered from remote sites. I've done a lot of this work using Python, in embedded Linux environments.
