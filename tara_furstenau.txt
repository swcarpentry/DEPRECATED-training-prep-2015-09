I am a PhD candidate in Molecular and Cellular Biology.  
I do research in spatial population genetics where I write
simulations to model populations in space and have developed Bayesian inference models to estimate population parameters.  
I write simulations in C++ and I analyze simulated data and genetic data using Python, R and Bash.
