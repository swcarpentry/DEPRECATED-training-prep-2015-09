I'm a professor of cognitive science and computer science at Occidental College. My research looks at how artificial intelligence agents can retrieve the right knowledge from a knowledge base at the right time, and includes the representation of that knowledge, the interfaces between agents and knowledge bases, as well as the strategic decisions when searching for knowledge. I draw inspiration from human memory phenomena, and in turn try to provide computational descriptions of human knowledge search.
