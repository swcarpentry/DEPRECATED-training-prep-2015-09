I am postdoctoral researcher working on marine viral ecology at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
My research involves creating code to model population dynamics and the tools to analyse them.
I've experience writing code in a few languages, but would like to gain more knowledge about how to teach these important skills!
