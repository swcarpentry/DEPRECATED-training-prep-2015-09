I am currently working in a privatly held company developing battery energy storages with the aim of rising the share of renewabe energy in the energy system. My role is being a team lead of a group that designs optimized control of battery parks and small energy systems, and that builds simulation tools in which the designs can be evaluated. My academic background is in system science.
