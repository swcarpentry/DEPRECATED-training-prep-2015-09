I am PhD candidate at Boston University in the Dept of Earth & Environment.
I use timeseries of remote sensing data to create descriptive histories of and
activitely monitor for land surface cover and condition change.
I used Python to develop a visualization tool and library for analyzing 
remote sensing timeseries.
