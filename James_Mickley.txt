I got bitten by the programming bug as a kid and since then have never stopped learning languages.  And I really like teaching!
I spent a few years as a programmer for an applied biomathematics company developing software for mathematical uncertainty calculus and ecological modeling.
Now I'm a PhD candidate in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut trying to figure out why so many species of plants have 5-petaled flowers.
