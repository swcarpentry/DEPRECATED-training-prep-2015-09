I am currently a PhD student at the University of Texas at Arlington, studying evolutionary biology using vertebrate systems, especially reptiles. My work leverages the growing resources and data surrounding whole-genome sequencing and as such, I have become quite proficient in learning and applying data analysis appraoches, including many that are educational foci of Software/Data Carpentry, to my work.
