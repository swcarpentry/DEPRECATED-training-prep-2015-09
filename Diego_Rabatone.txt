Hi, my name is Diego Rabatone Oliveira, I'm a brazilian hacker, engineer and developer.
I work mostly with Data related projects, from gathering Data, cleaning it, analyzing and 
creating visualizations.
Mostly I work with Python+R, git and shell scripts for gather, clean and analyze data,
JavaScript+HTML+CSS to build visualizations and
LaTeX to build documents.
