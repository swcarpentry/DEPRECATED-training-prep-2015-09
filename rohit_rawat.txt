I'm Rohit Rawat, a Ph.D. student in the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. I'm the president of the Linux User Group at our college, where over several years I have developed and taught topics like Linux shell scripting, version control with Git, the GNU C/C++ toolchain, SSH, and Markdown, among other things. I do research on machine learning, computer vision, and feature selection on high dimensional data. I routinely write code that works on short and extremely wide data files, which come directly from our collaborators in bioengineering and healthcare management areas. I work heavily in MATLAB, C/C++, and the R programming languages. Apart from the Linux User Group, I have experience teaching a Digital Signal Processing course as a full instructor in addition to being a TA for several courses over the years. I'd be happy to teach Data or Software carpentry as it is something I'm passionate for.
