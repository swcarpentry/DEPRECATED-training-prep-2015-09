I am a senior research scientist in the UNIC lab (Unité de Neurosciences,
Information et Complexité) of the CNRS, where I lead the Neuroinformatics
group. My ORCID identifier is 0000-0002-4793-7541.
My homepage is at http://www.andrewdavison.info

My main research interests are in large-scale, data-constrained,
biologically-detailed modelling of neuronal networks. My work at the moment
has several strands:

- development of models of the early visual system, from retina to primary
  visual cortex, in close collaboration with experimentalists.

- development of tools to facilitate collaborative modelling, model sharing,
  and the use of novel hardware (GPU, neuromorphic) for neuronal simulations,
  notably PyNN, NineML and NeuroML.

- promoting reproducible research in computational neuroscience and
  neuroinformatics, both through trying to spread best practices and through 
  tool development (see the Sumatra project).

- promoting neurophysiology data sharing, by participation in international 
  standardisation efforts, by development of tools to harmonize the handling
  of electrophysiology data in Python (see the Neo project), and by
  development of a framework to simplify databasing of neurophysiology data in
  small labs (see the Helmholtz project).
