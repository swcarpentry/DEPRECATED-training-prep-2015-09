I am a research scientist at NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis) at UCSB 
(University of California at Santa Barbara), training international governments, NGOs, and academics how to use 
the Ocean Health Index methodology, which is built with R/RStudio packages, displayed with Shiny, and distributed on GitHub.
