I am a new Assistant Professor at CSU Monterey Bay, working on questions in marine population genetics. I have previously used the Software Carpentry lessons for one of my classes, as well as hosting and co-teaching an SC workshop in Bali, Indonesia. I would like to be certified as an instructor for SC and DC to continue to bring these curricula to students in the Monterey Bay Area.
