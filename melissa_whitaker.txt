I am an evolutionary biologist studying interspecific associations between lycaenid butterflies, their gut bacteria, and ants. I have a PhD in Ecology from the University of California, Davis, and am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. As part of my postdoctoral fellowship, I am spending one year working at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. My work involves analyzing large high throughout sequencing datasets, and I am proficient in R and bash/unix.
