With a background as climate data scientist, and more recently as lead software developer in a start-up, I have just moved to a new position as scientific engineer working for the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) to support and develop the data science platform in the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science. One of my missions is to train scientists to use software data science tools.
