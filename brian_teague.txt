I'm a postdoctoral associate in Ron Weiss' lab, in the Synthetic Biology Center at MIT.
I'm interested in STEM pedegogy; I received a certificate with distinction in the 
"An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching" MOOC offered by
Vanderbilt University and a certificate in MIT's Kauffman Teaching Certificate Program.

I helped with the Boston University SWC workshop in May 2015.
