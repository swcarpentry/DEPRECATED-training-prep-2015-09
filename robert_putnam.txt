I work in Research Computing Services, a group within Information Services & Technology at
Boston University.  Our group runs the HPC computers on and off campus (e.g., at the
Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, MA) and provides
software consulting services to students and faculty on the Charles River and Medical
campuses.  I'm a C (previously Lisp) programmer by trade, but I am trying to come up to
speed in more modern languages, esp. Python.
