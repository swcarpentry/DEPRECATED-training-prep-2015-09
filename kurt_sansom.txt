I currently work on creating computational fluid dynamics
data for a patient specific dopplar ultrasound simulator
and creating a numerical and experimental validation 
framework for 4D-flow mri sequences. I am interested in
cardiovascular biomechanics, coupling reduced order
models with high fidelity models, predictive medicine,
and verificaiton of non-invasive patient specific
assessments.
