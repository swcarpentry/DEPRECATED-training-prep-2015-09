  I am a PhD student at the EPSRC centre for doctoral training in next generational
  computational modeling - my particular research project involves developing new
  non-linear methods for x-ray CT reconstruction. In a previous life I was a secondary
  school teacher and so I am very much interested in how we can develop excellent pedagogy
  in both computational modeling and mathematics.
