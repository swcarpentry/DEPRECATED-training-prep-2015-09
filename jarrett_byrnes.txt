I'm an assistant professor in the Biology department at UMass Boston. There, I am a marine community ecologist with a heavy emphasis on synthesis ecology. I've spend the last ten years working and developing in R, although I have some background in PERL. I currently teach computational approaches to data analysis to graduate students and am developing introductory to data science courses for undergraduates. 

I'm quite excited for this class to ramp up my pedagogical toolset and become a better instructor, both so that I can help spread open science techniques via SWC workshops as well as in my own classes at UMB.
