I am a Geography PhD candidate in the Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University.  In my research, I use time series of all available Landsat satellite imagery to map and monitor landscape dynamics. I am also interested in citizen science, particularly crowd-sourcing spatially explicit observations of species and habitat to improve the quality of landscape models. I greatly enjoy the art and practice of teaching, and after seeing some of Greg Wilson's videos on YouTube and Vimeo, I would love to have the opportunity to train as a Software Carpentry instructor.
