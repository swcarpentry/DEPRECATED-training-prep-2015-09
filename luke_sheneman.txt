My name is Luke Sheneman.   I have a background in Computer Science and a Ph.D in Bioinformatics.   
I am currently the Technology and Data Services Manager at the Northwest Knowledge Network (NKN) 
at the University of Idaho.   NKN strives to enable data-intensive science through innovative data 
management and the development of powerful data access discovery, and analytics capabilities.   
I manage a staff of talented programmers, data managers, systems administrators, and web developers. 
NKN is interested in participating as a group in both the upcoming Data and Software carpentry 
instructor training programs.
