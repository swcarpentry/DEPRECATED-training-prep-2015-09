I'm a PhD candidate in environmental and occupational health focusing on occupational ergonomics and biomechanics. My research concerns the effects of occupational exposures including whole body vibration on truckers and their musculoskeletal discomfort and cardiovascular health. I use mysql and r to store and analyse most of my research data and use git for my shared r code. I took a software carpentry course last year and presented in my department's new data and software course on my use of mysql for a multi-site randomized controlled trial.
