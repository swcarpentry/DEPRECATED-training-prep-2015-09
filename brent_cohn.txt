Hi! I'm Brent Cohn, and I work as an analyist in the Obermeyer Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. We do some really cool machine learning work.

I am genuinely passionate about helping others learn to program, and I've taught a class at Tufts University on the topic and volunteered with numerous groups around the Boston Area.
