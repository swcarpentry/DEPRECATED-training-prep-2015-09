I originally studied as an electrical engineer, and worked for 6 years
in the scientific instrumentation industry.

I loved working alongside biologists in academia, just joined the
biology PhD program, and am rotating in a microbial evolution lab
studying phylogeny using Python and Bash scripts.

I earn my bread as a sysadmin for the University's HPC cluster and
will be teaching a monthly 2 hour "Intro to HPC" user training class
(GNU/Linux commandline, scheduler, parallel computing).
